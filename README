Wesnoth Competitive Gaming
==========================

"The Battle for Wesnoth  is a Free, turn-based tactical strategy game with a
high fantasy theme, featuring both single-player, and online/hotseat
multiplayer combat." - wesnoth.org

This project aims at providing a better competitive gaming experience for
Wesnoth's multiplayer mode, especially for players who joined the Ladder of
Wesnoth [1]. It contains the Competitive Gaming add-on which can be found on
Wesnoth's add-on server. That allows ladder players to easily update their
Wesnoth clients. More information here [2]

However, it is not easy to have more than one collaborator for a Wesnoth add-on
(as updates would simply overwrite each other's changes), and the Coordinated
Wesnoth UMC Development project [3] still uses a subversion repository which
contains a lot of graphics and has simply become too big and also too slow if
you wanted to use git-svn.
